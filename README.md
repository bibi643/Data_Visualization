## Basic Overview

Here I will practice the use of 2 librairies I like for data visualization. 
Seaborn for the nice graphics and the easy to understand documentation.
Plotly for the interactive graphs which is also fully integrated to streamlit (useful for data project presentation).
It will be used a generic datasets for easier understanding for the audience.
The dataset is recording the transactions of 3 Branches during 3 months. The product they are selling are separated in 6 categories.
